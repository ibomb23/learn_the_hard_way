# learn_the_hard_way
A repository that helps me to learn the hard way.

My way to learn based on the webpage "https://learnpythonthehardway.org/" by Zed A. Shaw.
This way to learn seems suitable for me.

I hope i will complete the course in the next two months.
After this i will have a good base to go ahead in my devolopment career. :-)

Then, let's go practice!
